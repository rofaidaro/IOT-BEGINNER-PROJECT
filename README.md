# IOT-BEGINNER-PROJECT
IOT project for beginner, so easy.
 In this IOT project, you can control 8 home appliances
from the RemoteXY App with internet ,So this is a very useful
homemade smart home device that you can easily make with
these components.
 For this ESP8266 home automation project, We have not
used any custom design PCB. We have used the RemoteXY
IOT applications to control the relay from the smartphone
through WiFi. And instead of pushbuttons, you can also
connect manual switches or touch sensors to control the
home appliances
